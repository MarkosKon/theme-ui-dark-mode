# Theme UI dark mode example

This is an example repository for a [post I wrote](https://markoskon.com/dark-mode-in-react-with-theme-ui/) on how to implement dark mode with Theme UI.

Checkout to the `with-custom-theme` branch for an example with [my custom theme](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@affectionatedoor/gatsby-theme-ui) or to the `with-the-official-theme`/`master` for an example with the official [gatsby-plugin-theme-ui](https://theme-ui.com/gatsby-plugin).
